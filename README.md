# KSX-airdrop

The airdrop distribution of KSX is snapshotted from the block 2761158, the last block of Session 55533 which is the ending session before the first halving of ChainX. The dust accounts who had less than 1PCX have been excluded from the airdrop, the sum of dust balances will be transferred to the treasury account. The initial KSXs will be airdropped to all the non-dust accounts in 1:1 according to their PCX balance.

The snapshot is generated by the binary `snapshot_balances` contained in the CLI tool [chainx-cli](https://github.com/chainx-org/chainx-cli). The final generated KSX airdrop result can be found in [ksx_accounts_snapshot_2761158.json](./ksx_accounts_snapshot_2761158.json).
